### Here are the key differences between setTimeout() and setInterval() in JavaScript:

- setTimeout() runs a function once after a specified delay. setInterval() runs a function repeatedly with a fixed time delay between each call.

- setTimeout() takes a function and a delay in milliseconds as arguments. setInterval() takes a function and a delay in milliseconds as arguments.

- setTimeout() returns a timeoutId that can be used to cancel the timeout. setInterval() returns an intervalId that can be used to cancel the interval.

- setTimeout() executes the function once after the specified delay. setInterval() executes the function repeatedly with the specified delay between each call.

- setTimeout() does not guarantee precise execution time, callbacks may be delayed by a few milliseconds. setInterval() also has the same issue.

- Using setInterval() can potentially cause performance issues or memory leaks if not properly handled. setTimeout() only executes once so no such concerns.

- Nested setTimeout() can be used to simulate setInterval() functionality. Vice versa is not possible.

### So in summary:

1. setTimeout for running a function once after a delay

2. setInterval for running a function repeatedly with a fixed delay

3. setTimeout is more precise, setInterval can drift

4. setInterval requires cleanup to avoid issues, setTimeout does not
